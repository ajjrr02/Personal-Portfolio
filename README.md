For Some time now i wanted to fool around with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) Combined ,
This personal Portfolio of mine, is the result of that.

Since Tailwind uses a mobile-first approach, I decided to follow suit and worked on the mobile version before adjusting for the rest of the viewports.(meaning i started with the Small Screen Approach and working mmy way to bigger screen adaptivity.)

## Features

- light/dark mode
- fully accessible
- full-screen mobile menu
- custom 404 page (try and input a wrong slug üôà)
- ‚ÄúBack to top‚Äù button showing up on scroll
- meta tags to make it easy to share on different social networks
- amazing performance on both mobile and desktop
- favicons for all devices and color theme for browsers that support the color feature


## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
